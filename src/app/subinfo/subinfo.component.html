    <p style="color:orange"> COVID-19 data were collected, cross-checked, and published from 56 US states and territories. 
      These numbers were compiled to provide the most complete picture of the US COVID-19 testing effort and 
      the outbreakâ€™s effects on the people and communities it strikes. The full dataset is updated daily between 5pm and 6pm Eastern Time,
      with limited additional updates as new information arrives.
